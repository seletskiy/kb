How to type faster
==================

# Keyboard

Essentially, you need good keyboard.

The reason is simple: how many time you spend typing? Most of fellow typist
spent this time on shitty cheap keyboards.

Currently, I'm typing on CM Storm QuickFire Stealth with brown switches.

One of the alternative is BTC Slim Scissor-switch keyboards, but they stands
not even near mechanical one.

# Habits

Once you will became good enough for touch typing, it's hard to push yourself
out of limits without any additional restrictions.

One of those restrictions gladly given by standard `xset` tool, which can be
used for configure delay and repeat rate between keypresses.

Default settings can be significantly lowered even without any training.

For example, `xset r rate 120 90` means, that if key was pressed longer than
120ms, it will be repeated in rate of 90 keypresses in second ([yep, per second](https://gist.github.com/seletskiy/dd7d4e628635c345d376)).

Try to use values such as `200 60` at the beginning.

Decrease delay interval and increase repeat rate as soon as you became
comfortable with current settings.

Even `120 90` settings felt like lightning speed for untrained person.
